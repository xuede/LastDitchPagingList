# LastDitchPagingList Utility

## Description
The `LastDitchPagingList.py` script is a crucial tool designed to assist library staff in recovering the paging list of items when the original list is lost, and the master list fails to function. This utility does not generate shipping labels but solely focuses on retrieving the list of items that must be pulled from the library shelves.

## Prerequisites
- **Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your machine. The script does not require any additional dependencies.

## Installation
No installation is required. Simply download the `LastDitchPagingList.py` script to your local machine where Python is available.

## Usage
To use the script, follow these steps:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where `LastDitchPagingList.py` is saved.

4. You will be prompted to select your library by entering the corresponding number.

The script will then process the information and display the list of items to be pulled for the specified date.

## Features
